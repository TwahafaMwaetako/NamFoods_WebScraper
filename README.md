GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a sample README file for your Namibia Supermarket Price Checker Chrome extension:

# Namibia Supermarket Price Checker

This is a Chrome extension that checks the prices of retail supermarkets in Namibia and sends notifications when the price of an item has dropped. The extension targets Pick and Pay, Food Lovers Market, and Shoprite.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.
5. Go to one of the supermarket websites and wait for the extension to notify you of a price drop.

## Usage

To use the extension, simply browse to one of the supported supermarket websites and wait for the extension to check the prices. If the price of an item has dropped, the extension will send a notification to your browser.

You can also use the popup window to save prices for items that you're interested in. Simply enter the name and price of the item and click "Save". The extension will save the item to your browser's storage and display a message indicating that the item was saved successfully.

You can clear all saved items by clicking the "Clear" button in the popup window.
